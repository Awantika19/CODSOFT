                <h2>Missile Man of India</h2>

                <p><b>Dr. Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</b>, commonly known as A.P.J. Abdul Kalam (15 October 1931 â€“ 27 July 2015), was an eminent Indian scientist, educator, and statesman. He played a pivotal role in India's space and missile development programs and served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007.

                    Kalam's contributions extended beyond his work in the defense and space sectors. He was an advocate for science education and youth empowerment. He believed in harnessing the potential of India's youth to drive the country's progress. He often interacted with students and young people, inspiring them to pursue careers in science and technology.
                    
                    In 2002, Kalam was elected as the President of India, and he served in this role until 2007. During his presidency, he continued to emphasize the importance of education and youth development. After his presidency, he remained an active speaker, writer, and mentor, promoting his vision for a developed and technologically advanced India.
                    
                    Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam passed away on 27 July 2015 while delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong. He is fondly remembered as the "People's President" and the "Missile Man of India" for his significant contributions to science, technology, and the nation as a whole.
